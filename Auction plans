Auction plans:

Bidding system:
    Adding bid:
        can be an image, or a sound file (has a max size but idk anything about that so idk what it woudl be)
            with a discription up to 200 characters
        can also be a txt file of up to 1000 characters
        must initlize starting price and bid incraments 
            default starting price is 1 wolvercoin and default bid incrament is 0.5 wolvercoin
        must initlize bid time
    Auction:
        someone puts in bid before bid time ends
            if no bid before bid time ends item goes to the shop
        every time someone puts in bid bid time extends by 2 minutes
        system to pool money (?)
            like maybe option to add multiple people to a party to pool funds
        cannot bid more money than you own (duh)
        can add comment to bid (to maybe persuade people to be nice??) 100 characters
    Shop:
        if you dont wanna auction something just sell it for a set price
        add item (same as auction) and sell price
        also if item is not bid on then its at shop
    UI:
        dropdown bar to go to dif places ie: shop, add bid, acution room, chat room

                initlal price
                bid incrament
                discription
            also place to upload image/sound
